what is the standard treatment for ventricular fibrillation

The standard treatment for ventricular fibrillation is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. CPR is a life-saving technique that involves chest compressions and rescue breathing in order to maintain blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. Defibrillation is a procedure that uses a device to deliver a shock to the heart in order to try to restore a normal heart rhythm. If CPR and defibrillation are successful, they can help to restore blood flow to the body and save the person's life. In some cases, medication or other medical procedures may also be necessary to treat ventricular fibrillation.

describe vertical envelopment and the ideal time to use this tactic in urban warfare

Vertical envelopment is a military tactic in which forces are inserted into an area from above, typically by parachute or helicopter. This allows them to quickly and quietly gain access to an objective, such as a building or fortified position, from an unexpected direction. This tactic is often used in urban warfare, where the tight confines and complex terrain of a city can make it difficult for ground forces to maneuver and attack. The ideal time to use vertical envelopment in urban warfare is when an objective must be quickly and quietly seized without alerting the enemy or causing widespread destruction. This may be necessary in order to prevent the enemy from reinforcing the objective or using it to launch an attack.
